## What kind of query should be written for these dashboards?

### Infected_Host
source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational" 
(signature="Trojan*" OR signature="Virus*" OR signature="Worm*")

| stats dc(host) as Host

### Detail_List
source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational" 
(signature="Trojan*" OR signature="Virus*" OR signature="Worm*")

| stats count by host user signature

### Total_Malware_Count
source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational" 
(signature="Trojan*" OR signature="Virus*" OR signature="Worm*")

| stats count as Total_Malware

### Update_Status_isnâ€™t_Success
index="main" source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational" category=update

| search status!=success

| stats latest(date) as date, latest(status) as status, latest(Product_Version) as Product_Version by host category

| table date host category status Product_Version

### Latest_Update_Status
index="main" source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational" category=update

| stats latest(date) as date, latest(status) as status, latest(Product_Version) as Product_Version by host category

| table date host category status Product_Version

### Host / Date
source=* (EventCode=4625 OR EventCode=4624)

| eval action=if(EventCode=4625, "failure", "success")

| bin span=1d _time

| stats count(eval(action="failure")) as Failure_Count, count(eval(action="success")) as Success_Count by host, _time

| where Failure_Count > 100 AND Success_Count > 0

| stats count by host _time

### Details
source=* (EventCode=4625 OR EventCode=4624)

| eval action=if(EventCode=4625, "failure", "success")

| bin span=1d _time

| stats count(eval(action="failure")) as Failure_Count, count(eval(action="success")) as Success_Count by host, _time

| where Failure_Count > 100 AND Success_Count > 0
